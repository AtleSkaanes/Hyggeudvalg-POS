# Hyggeudvalg-ordrer-POS-webapp
by: [MathiTC](https://github.com/MathiTC) & [AtleSkaanes](https://github.com/AtleSkaanes)

This is a project for a school club, that makes fun afternoons.
This repository is for a POS-system, so we will be able to easily keep track on what we have sold each event.
This may lead to a online ordering service, where students at the event can just buy food from their browser, and then a waiter will come and give them their food.
